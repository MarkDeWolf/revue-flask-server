<h2>404</h2>
<p>
    Year 404 (CDIV) was a leap year starting on Friday (link will display the full calendar) of the Julian calendar.
    At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Honorius and Aristaenetus (or, less frequently, year
    1157 Ab urbe condita).
    The denomination 404 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar
    era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.
